# Activity 14 – GitHub & Reproducible Report

This repository contains my work connected to **Activity 14**, where I practice using
GitHub and Quarto to create a reproducible analysis. The repo demonstrates branching,
Issues, pull requests, commit structure, and documentation.

## What This Repo Is About

- Store the Activity 14 Quarto source file (`activity14.qmd`).
- Store the rendered PDF report (`activity14.pdf`).
- Show evidence of using Git and GitHub features such as branches, Issues, and pull requests.
- Document the overall plan for both the repository and the Activity 14 analysis.
