# two-way frequency table ()

library(dplyr); library(tidyr); library(knitr)

af_army_enl \<- armed_forces %\>%\
filter(branch == "Army", component == "Enlisted") %\>%\
count(sex, rank_name, name = "n")

af_table \<- af_army_enl %\>%\
pivot_wider(names_from = rank_name, values_from = n, values_fill = 0L)
%\>%\
arrange(sex)

kable(af_table, caption = "Table 1. Army (Enlisted): Frequency of
soldiers by Sex and Rank")

Counts of Army enlisted by sex across E1–E9. Most observations are in
E4–E6, fewer at E1 and E9.

# Popularity of Baby Names

*Goal:* Load **BabyNames**, filter to five names , and plot
**2019–2024** as a time series.; facets separate sex (so not
color-only).

# wrangle

library(dcData); library(dplyr); library(tidyr)\
data("BabyNames")

nm \<- names(BabyNames)\
if ("prop" %in% nm) val_col \<- "prop" else\
if ("n" %in% nm) val_col \<- "n" else\
val_col \<- "count"

bn \<- BabyNames \|\>\
rename(value = !!val_col) \|\>\
mutate(year = as.integer(year))

chosen_names \<- c("Olivia","Emma","Ava","Liam","Noah")

bn_sel \<- bn \|\>\
filter(name %in% chosen_names, year \>= 2019, year \<= 2024) \|\>\
group_by(year, sex, name) \|\>\
summarise(value = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

**Why these names & what the lines show.** I picked five very common
names to keep the plot readable. Some stay steady; others drift.
